                    <p>In 1770, Haytham and Kaniehtí:io's son Ratonhnhaké:ton traveled to Boston with his mentor Achilles Davenport to buy supplies for their homestead. During the trip, Achilles chose "Connor" to be the boy's alias. After purchasing their supplies, a protest began outside the Old State House. Connor spotted his father and was ordered to follow his accomplice onto the rooftop. Connor stopped the man from firing his rifle, but on the opposite roof, Lee fired a shot, prompting the British soldiers to fire on the crowd. Haytham spotted Connor and pointed him out to a Grenadier, forcing Connor to flee. Samuel Adams later found Connor and helped him escape the city by advising him to tear down his wanted posters and showing him how to bribe town criers and printers, before taking him through the Freemasons' tunnels to a harbor.[2]</p>

            Lara Croft is the main protagonist and playable character of the
            video game series: she travels around the world in search of many
            forgotten artefacts and locations, frequently connected to supernatural
            powers. While her biography has changed throughout the series, her
            shared traits are her origins as the only daughter and heir of the
            aristocratic Croft family.She is portrayed as intelligent, athletic,
            elegant, fluent in multiple languages, and determined to fulfil her
            own goals at any cost. She has brown eyes and brown hair worn in a
            braid or ponytail. The character's classic outfit consists of a 
            turquoise singlet, light brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall
            white socks. Recurring accessories include fingerless gloves, a
            backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and twin
            pistols. Later games have multiple new outfits for her</p>
